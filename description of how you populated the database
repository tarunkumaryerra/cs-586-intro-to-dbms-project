A brief description of how you populated the database
• I have populated the data on my own depending on the queries which
ever I need.
• I have designed the database in such a realistic way that resembles the
real scenario which is presently being used by the big merchanants and
gold smith business.
• I have randomly generated the customer names, address, showroom
names, manufacturer names using the https://www.mockaroo.com/
where it has a feature of generating random set of values in bulk which is
fake and irrelevant to any means of data.
• Mockaroo has a great data mocking libraries available for almost every
language and platform. But not everyone is a programmer or has time to
learn a new framework. Mockaroo allows you to quickly and easily to
download large amounts of randomly generated test data based on your
own specs which you can then load directly into your test environment
using SQL or CSV formats. No programming is required.
• Using the above tool I have generated the data for six tables i.e Customer,
Orders,Manufacturers, Showroom, Company, Billamount.
